/**
 * Validates the allowed Composer plugins, both in active and stage.
 *
 * Composer plugins can make far-reaching changes on the filesystem. That is why
 * they can cause Package Manager (more specifically the infrastructure it uses:
 * php-tuf/composer-stager) to not work reliably; potentially even break a site!
 *
 * This validator restricts the use of Composer plugins:
 * - Allowing all plugins to run indiscriminately is discouraged by Composer,
 *   but disallowed by this module (it is too risky):
 *   `config.allowed-plugins = true` is forbidden.
 * - Installed Composer plugins that are not allowed (in composer.json's
 *   `config.allowed-plugins ) are not executed by Composer, so
 *   these are safe.
 * - Installed Composer plugins that are allowed need to be either explicitly
 *   supported by this validator (they may still need their own validation to
 *   ensure their configuration is safe, for example Drupal core's vendor
 *   hardening plugin), or explicitly trusted by adding it to the
 *   `package_manager.settings` configuration's
 *   `additional_trusted_composer_plugins` list.
 *
 * @todo Determine how other Composer plugins will be supported in
 *    https://drupal.org/i/3339417.
 *
 * @see https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#type
 * @see https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/plugins.md
 *
 * @internal
 *   This is an internal part of Package Manager and may be changed or removed
 *   at any time without warning. External code should not interact with this
 *   class.
