## Requirements

This module requires no module other than [Drupal core toolbar][3].

## Installation

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.\
For further information, see [Installing Drupal Modules][4].

## Configuration

### Display the search input in the tray of a toolbar item tab:

If enabled, instead of displaying the search text field directly in the toolbar, it displays a menu item in the toolbar so the user has to click on it to toggle the display of the tray containing the search field.

### Search focus keyboard shortcut: Alt + a

It is possible to immediately focus (jump to) the Admin Toolbar Search input field by pressing the keyboard combination of keys: Alt + a

If the keyboard shortcut `Alt + a` (enabled by default) enters in conflict with any existing shortcut combinations, then __it is recommended to disable this setting for now__, until it could be made configurable, see [Feature request #3087173: Allow shortcut keys to be configurable][5].
