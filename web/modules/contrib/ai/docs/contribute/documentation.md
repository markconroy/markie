# Contribute Documentation

> Please make sure you follow the [AI module issue guidelines](issue_guidelines.md).

This section covers how you can contribute documentation to the AI module. Documentation is crucial for helping users and developers understand how to use and contribute to the AI module effectively. We as maintainers are sometimes to deep into the code to see the forest for the trees, so it might be useful to have a fresh pair of eyes on the documentation.

## Where do I find this documentation
In the GitLab [repository](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/ai) there is a docs repository. All documentation you see on this page have been built from that.
This means that if you want an offline version of this documentation, this is where you can find it. This also means that you contribute to the documentation by creating a merge request in the repository.

So any documentation first requires you to create a ticket in the [AI Issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/ai?categories=All) with a description of what you want to contribute in the form of documentation.

This means that you will get credits for your contribution, when its merged into the documentation.

Read more about it in the [Documentation](../documentation/index.md) section.
