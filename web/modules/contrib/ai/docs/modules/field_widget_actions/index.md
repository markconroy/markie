# Field Widget Actions Module

## What is the Field Widget Actions module?

The Field Widget Actions module provides an easy way to attach action buttons to form fields.

The module doesn't do anything by itself, but is a builder module that allows other modules to provide processors that can be used to trigger processes on form fields that fills out the field or gives suggestions on how to fill out the field.

This works with any field as long as the processor is configured to work with that field type.

## Dependencies

The Field Widget Actions module can be installed by itself, but it does require a processor to be installed to be actually useful.

It also requires the Field UI module to be installed if you want to configure the field widget actions in the UI - however, you can always run the configured field widget actions without the Field UI module if they have been setup.

## Known processors
You can click on the links in the menu to see how to configure the processors for different field types. But the following processors are known:

* AI Automators
* AI Content Suggestions
* [ECA](https://ecaguide.org/plugins/eca/base/events/eca_base_eca_field_widget/)
* AI Agents

## How to configure a Field Widget Action

This will just be general information on how to configure a field widget action, as the actual configuration will depend on the processor you are using.

1. Setup an entity type, node or any other content entity type that is fieldable.
2. Add a field to the entity type that you want to attach the action to.
3. Visit Manage Form Display for the entity type.
4. Click on the cog icon next to the field you want to attach the action to.
5. In the "Field Widget Actions" section, select the processor you want to use.
6. Configure the processor settings as needed.
7. Save the configuration.

## How to create your own Field Widget Action plugin

Create a plugin class in `Plugin\FieldWidgetAction` namespace. It is recommended to extend `FieldWidgetActionBase` class
in order to focus on functionality of your plugin itself and not do any form integration. Of course you can implement
all methods from the `FieldWidgetActionInterface` on your own. For actions with suggestions there are two helper methods
in the base class:
- `returnSuggestions` that will help to display the suggestions in a modal dialog with ability to use selected value in
the form field directly in case the form element selector is provided;
- `getSuggestionsTarget` - that gets the selector for the most common use cases of a suggestions action. In special
cases the plugin can overwrite the method to use its own logic.
- `getTargetElementDelta` - that gets the delta for the field widget form element.
- `getTargetElementFieldName` - that gets the corresponding field name of the form element.

The methods are protected ones, therefore, they are not part of the interface (as not all actions
provide suggestions).

## Setup Field Widget Action with a recipe

The module provides config action `setComponentThirdPartySetting` that helps you to integrate your action into form
display using Drupal recipes. There is a core issue to add this config action, but it is not added yet to any version of
Drupal, that is why this action was added to the module directly, but with some limitations: the action only works for
entity form displays (as field widget action can be added only to the form), and the only provider for 3rd party
settings is 'field_widget_actions' module. For the installations that will be using Drupal version with core config
action `setComponentThirdPartySetting`, the core plugin will prevail.

The example of usage:
```
config:
  actions:
    core.entity_form_display.node.page.default:
      setComponentThirdPartySetting:
        component: page_preview_text
        provider: field_widget_actions
        settings:
          bc6795f3-3956-4df2-bd64-980e5002579c:
            plugin_id: prompt_content_suggestion
            enabled: false
            weight: 0
            button_label: 'Summaries'
            settings:
              model: ''
              prompt: 'Summaries given text'
```
The above example adds to the form element "Preview text" for "Page" content type the field widget action from "AI
content suggestions" module.

It is also possible to configure 2 components when providing the array of settings:
```
config:
  actions:
    core.entity_form_display.node.page.default:
      setComponentThirdPartySetting:
        -
          component: page_preview_text
          provider: field_widget_actions
          settings:
            bc6795f3-3956-4df2-bd64-980e5002579c:
              plugin_id: prompt_content_suggestion
              enabled: true
              weight: 0
              button_label: 'Summaries'
              settings:
                model: ''
                prompt: 'Summaries given text'
        -
          component: title
          provider: field_widget_actions
          settings:
            ec6795f3-3956-4df2-bd64-980e5002129d:
              plugin_id: prompt_content_suggestion
              enabled: true
              weight: 0
              button_label: 'Generate Title'
              settings:
                model: ''
                prompt: 'Suggest 5 titles for the given content'
```
