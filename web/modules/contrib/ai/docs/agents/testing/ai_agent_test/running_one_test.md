# Running on Test

## Run the test
On the listings page you will see a button called "Run Once". Just click this and it will run against the default AI Chat with Tools provider.

## Results
You will now see the detailed results of the test. The results will show you the input, output, tools used, and any additional information relevant to that test run.

You will most importantly see the detailed results of the rules you set up for the test. If the test passed, you will see a green dot next to the rule, and if it failed, you will see a red dot. Depending on the rule, you will see expected value and actual value, and in some cases details about why it failed or succeeded.
