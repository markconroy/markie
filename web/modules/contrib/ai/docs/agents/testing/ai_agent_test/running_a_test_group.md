# Run a Test Group

## Run the test group
On the group listing page you will see a button called "Run". Just click this and it will open up a form where  you can select the provider and model you want to run the test group against.

Then start.

## Results
You will see in realtime while its running the results of the test group. The results will show you the name and if its a failure or success and a button to detailed results. The detailed results is the same as you have when you [run a single test](running_one_test.md), but for all tests in the group.

You will also see the overall result of the test group, which is based on the percentage success threshold you set when you created the test group. If the average success rate of the tests in the group is above that threshold, the group is considered successful.
