    "# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on\ncreating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human\nintelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving,\nunderstanding natural language, and perception.\n\n## Key Areas of AI",
    "## Key Areas of AI\n\n### 1. Machine Learning\nMachine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to\nmake predictions or decisions based on data. ML models improve their\nperformance over time as they are exposed to more data.\n\n#### Supervised Learning\nIn supervised learning, models are",
    "supervised learning, models are trained on labeled data, meaning the input\ndata is paired with the correct output. Examples include classification and\nregression tasks.\n\n#### Unsupervised Learning\nUnsupervised learning involves training models on data without labeled\nresponses. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns or structures in the data,",
    "structures in the data,\nsuch as clustering or association.\n\n#### Reinforcement Learning\nReinforcement learning is a type of ML where an agent learns to make decisions\nby performing actions and receiving feedback through rewards or penalties.\n\n### 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nNLP is a field of AI that focuses",
    "field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and\nhumans through natural language. It involves tasks such as language\ntranslation, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition.\n\n### 3. Computer Vision\nComputer Vision enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on\nvisual data from the world. Applications include image and video",
    "Applications include image and video recognition,\nobject detection, and facial recognition.\n\n### 4. Robotics\nAI is integral to robotics, allowing robots to perform complex tasks such as\nnavigation, manipulation, and interaction with humans.
