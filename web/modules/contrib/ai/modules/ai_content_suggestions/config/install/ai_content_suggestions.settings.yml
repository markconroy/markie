field_widget_prompt: |
  You will be asked to help with content suggestions based on the input in markdown format. Answer with
  suggestions only, do not repeat the task description, do not use any other text except for the suggestions.
  Wrap each suggestion in span tag that has the class "ai-cs-use". Here is an example of a single suggestion:
  ```html
  <span class="ai-content-suggestion"><span class="ai-use-cs">Suggestion</span></span>
  ```
  If there are multiple suggestions, ensure that these are wrapped in <li> tags inside an ordered list <ol>.
  Here is an example of multiple suggestions:
  ```html
  <ol>
    <li>
      <span class="ai-content-suggestion">
        <span class="ai-use-cs">Suggestion</span>
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="ai-content-suggestion">
        <span class="ai-use-cs">Another suggestion</span>
      </span>
    </li>
  </ol>
  ```
