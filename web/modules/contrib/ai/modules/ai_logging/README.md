# AI Logging
## What is the AI Logging module
The AI logging module allows developers to capture prompts sent to and outputs
received from LLMs by other modules and store them as entities to allow for
review and debugging. Whilst this module is safe to use on a production
environment, it stores a large amount of data into the database and so is
**recommended only to aid local development**.

## How to configure the AI Logging module
For more information, please see the [AI Logging module documentation](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai/modules/ai_logging/index.md).
