# AI API Explorer
## What is the AI API Explorer module?
This module provides a number of forms which a site builder can use to test out
the results of various API calls, and in some cases obtain boilerplate code to
recreate those calls in a module. **This module is only intended to be used as
part of development:** it should only be used to test a given prompt against a
selected LLM.

The forms which will appear depend on the specific modules and providers you
have configured. Other modules may provide additional forms provided as they
require: please see the developers section for more details.

## How to use the module
For more information, please see the [AI API Explorer module documentation](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai/modules/ai_api_explorer/index.md).
