# AI Observability

The AI Observability module logs calls to AI providers to the Drupal Logger
(currently) and OpenTelemetry endpoints (in the future), including detailed
information like request duration, token usage, optionally input prompts text
and output, etc.

This makes it possible to track the usage of tokens per user, per provider,
build aggregated reports and usage charts, calculate cost usage an expenses,
limit per-week token usage per user, and many more.

This module only produce logs, that can be stored anywhere - in the local Drupal
database, Syslog, file, cloud log collectors.

For quick start and local development it's recommended to use the "Extended Logger"
module in conjunction with its submodule, "Extended Logger DB", to store logs
generated by this module into the Drupal Database as well as providing a page
to review these logs.

For production, it's recommended to use production-ready log scrappers.
