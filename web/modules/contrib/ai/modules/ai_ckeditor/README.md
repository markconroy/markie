# AI CKEditor integration
## What is the AI CKEditor integration module?
The AI CKEditor integration module provides a number of plugins that integrate
with core's CK Editor 5 module. These plugins allow data to be passed to an LLM
to allow it to make suggests about content, from translations to tone
suggestions to text completion.

### Contextual Balloon Menu
The module includes a contextual balloon menu that appears automatically when you select text in the editor. This provides quick access to AI actions like translation, tone modification, and summarization without having to use the toolbar button.

To use this feature:
1. Select text in the CKEditor
2. A contextual menu will appear near your selection
3. Choose the AI action you want to perform on the selected text
4. Complete the action in the dialog that appears

The same AI plugins are available through both the toolbar button and the contextual menu.

## Using the module
Check the [AI CKEditor integration module guide](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/ai/latest/modules/ai_ckeditor/) for
information on using the module.
